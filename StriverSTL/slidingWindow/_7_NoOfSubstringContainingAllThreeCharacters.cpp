/*Approach 2: Last Position Tracking
Intuition
Instead of thinking in terms of a sliding window, we can take a different perspective: for each position in the string, how many valid substrings end at this position? The key observation is that a substring is valid if it contains at least one occurrence of each required character (a, b, and c). However, instead of tracking exact counts, we only care about where the most recent occurrence of each character is.

Let's use the string "abcab" as an example. When we reach position 4 (the last 'b'), we need to include at least one 'a' and one 'c' to form valid substrings ending at this 'b'. Looking backward, we find the last 'a' at position 3 and the last 'c' at position 2. To create a valid substring, we must include everything from the leftmost required character up to our current position.

This reveals an important pattern. At every position, we determine the leftmost occurrence among the last seen positions of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The number of valid substrings ending at this position is simply the number of possible starting points, which range from the beginning of the string up to this leftmost position.

In our "abcab" example, at position 4:

The last 'a' appears at position 3.
The last 'b' is at our current position 4.
The last 'c' appears at position 2.
Since 'c' appears leftmost at position 2, any substring starting at positions 0, 1, or 2 and ending at position 4 will be valid. This gives us three valid substrings at this position!

This leads to a simple counting method: at each position, we add 1 plus the minimum of the last positions of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. We add 1 because if the minimum position is k, we can start our substring at any position from 0 to k, giving us k+1 possible starting points.

To handle cases where a character hasn't appeared yet, we initialize its last position as -1. When calculating the minimum of the last positions, finding a -1 tells us we don't have all the required characters yet, so we won't count any substrings at that position.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the sliding window technique, check out the Sliding Window Explore Card ðŸ”—. This resource provides an in-depth look at the sliding window approach, explaining its key concepts and applications with a variety of problems to solidify understanding of the pattern.

Algorithm
Initialize variables:
len to store the length of the input string.
total to store the count of valid substrings.
Create an integer array lastPos of size 3 with all values set to -1 to track the most recent positions of characters a, b, and c.
For each position pos from 0 to len:
Update the last position of the current character in the lastPos array.
Find the minimum position among the last positions of a, b, and c.
If all characters are present, the minimum gives the leftmost required character position.
Add 1 plus this minimum position to the total count (accounting for 0-based indexing).
Return the total count of valid substrings.
The slideshow below demonstrates the algorithm in action:

Implementation

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int len = s.length();
        // Track last position of a, b, c
        vector<int> lastPos = {-1, -1, -1};
        int total = 0;

        for (int pos = 0; pos < len; pos++) {
            // Update last position of current character
            lastPos[s[pos] - 'a'] = pos;

            // Add count of valid substrings ending at current position
            // If any character is missing, min will be -1
            // Else min gives leftmost required character position
            total += 1 + min({lastPos[0], lastPos[1], lastPos[2]});
        }

        return total;
    }
};

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input string s.

Time complexity: O(n)

The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once using a single loop that runs n times. Each iteration performs a constant amount of work, including updating the lastPos array and computing the minimum of three values. Thus, the overall time complexity remains linear, i.e., O(n).

Space complexity: O(1)

The algorithm maintains a fixed-size array lastPos of length 3 to track the last seen positions of characters a, b, and c. Since this array does not grow with the input size, the space usage is constant, i.e., O(1). */
